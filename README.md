# K-Means-Clustering Project on Customer Segmentation
The Use of Unsupervised Learning in Customer Segmentation

## Overview
This project applies the k-means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their behaviors. The goal is to provide insights for targeted marketing strategies.

## Methodology
We used the k-means clustering algorithm in Python to segment customers. The process involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and applying the clustering algorithm.

## How to Run the Code
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main script: `python kmeans_clustering.py` 

## Results
We identified distinct customer segments that can be targeted differently to optimize marketing resources.

## Key Findings
- Segment 1: New customers with lower total spend.
- Segment 2: Loyal customers with high frequency and spend.
